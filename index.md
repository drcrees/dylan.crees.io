ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, fancy seeing you here.  If you don't already know, my name is Dylan.  I'm a techy, tinkerer, and avid learner.
You can often find me in the garage futzing with my 1987 BMW 325 (E30), working on my home lab, or hanging out with my wife and cat.

Professionally, I'm a lead cloud engineer at [Hy-Vee](https://www.hy-vee.com/) with a focus on automation, DevOps, and engineering productivity.

I obtained my BS in Computer Science at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/).

This site is very much a work in progress, but when I have time I intend to share more about the things I'm actively involved in or find interesting.
So stay tuned! ðŸ¤˜
